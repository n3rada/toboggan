# Toboggan

üõù Slide into post-exploitation from RCE with ease. Toboggan wraps your remote command execution into a upgradable dumb shell, making the post-exploitation phase better.

## Getting Started

Installing Toboggan is simple. You can install it directly from the repository:
```shell
pip install 'toboggan@git+https://github.com/n3rada/toboggan.git'
```

Or, by using [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) (and you should):
```shell
pipx install 'git+https://github.com/n3rada/toboggan.git'
```

Once installed, you can execute it using:
```shell
toboggan -m ~/phpexploit.py
```

### BurpSuite

To route traffic through Burp Suite:
```shell
toboggan -m ~/phpexploit.py --burp
```

You can also directly import a Burp saved request that contains the `||cmd||` placeholder:
```shell
toboggan -r brequest
```

## üîç What is an RCE Python Module?

A Remote Code Execution (RCE) module is a Python script designed to handle remote command execution. To be compatible with Toboggan, the module must include an execute function with the following signature:

```python
def execute(command: str, timeout: float) -> str:
    """
    Execute a command remotely and return the output.
    
    Args:
        command (str): The command to execute.
        timeout (float): Execution timeout.

    Returns:
        str: The command output.
    """
```

This function will be called internally by Toboggan to execute commands remotely.

## üèóÔ∏è Making Dumb Shells Smarter

### Named Pipes for Semi-Interactive Shells
Toboggan uses named pipes (FIFO - First In, First Out) for inter-process communication (IPC). Named pipes are particularly useful when working with RCE over limited channels like HTTP requests or restricted command execution interfaces.

This allows Toboggan to simulate pseudo-TTY behavior, even in restricted environments behind firewalls. To enable named pipe mode, use the `--fifo` flag:
```shell
toboggan -m ~/phpexploit.py --fifo
```

Toboggan will create a FIFO-based communication channel, allowing you to interact with the remote system in a more dynamic way (e.g., using `sudo -l`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Actions: Customizable Remote Interactions

Actions in Toboggan are modular plugins that allow you to extend its functionality. Actions can automate common post-exploitation tasks, such as downloading files, executing scripts, or setting up persistent access.

### Custom Actions
Custom actions allow you to define your own automation workflows. Actions should be placed in `~/.local/share/toboggan/actions` (Linux) or `%APPDATA%\toboggan\actions` (Windows).
