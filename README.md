# Toboggan

üõù Slide into post-exploitation from RCE with ease. Toboggan wraps your remote command execution into a upgradable dumb shell, sliding directly into post-exploitation phase. It allows you to fastly launch a `mkfifo` forward-shell inside a targeted Linux environment.

## Installation

Installing Toboggan is simple. You can install it directly from the repository:

```shell
pip install 'toboggan@git+https://github.com/n3rada/toboggan.git'
```

### Using [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)
Be careful, it installs Python applications in isolated virtual environments, which means they do not have access to system-wide packages by default (like `psycopg2`).
```shell
pipx install 'git+https://github.com/n3rada/toboggan.git'
```

If you want-it to use system site packages, pass `--system-site-packages` when installing via `pipx`.

## Execution

Once installed, you can execute it using:
```shell
toboggan -m ~/phpexploit.py
```

When you are knowing what you are doing, you can also do:
```shell
toboggan -m ~/phpexploit.py --camouflage --fifo --os "unix" -wd /dev/shm/apache-tmp
```

It will start a FiFo named-pipe (a.k.a `mkfifo` shell, forward-shell) on `unix` (`--os`) remote system and obfuscating all commands using the [hide.py](./toboggan/actions/hide/unix.py) actions.

### Proxy

You can forward to your favorite proxifier such as your favorite [`Squid`](https://www.squid-cache.org/) server using the `--proxy` parameter:

```shell
toboggan -m ~/phpexploit.py --proxy http://squidrandom.<something>.io:3128
```

### BurpSuite

To route traffic through Burp Suite:
```shell
toboggan -m ~/phpexploit.py --proxy
```

You can also directly import a Burp saved request that contains the `||cmd||` placeholder:
```shell
toboggan -r brequest
```

## üîç What is an RCE Python Module?

A Remote Code Execution (RCE) module is a Python script that defines how commands are sent to and executed on a remote system. Toboggan uses this module to wrap and streamline post-exploitation command execution.

To be compatible with Toboggan, your module must define a function with the following exact signature:

```python
def execute(command: str, timeout: float) -> str:
    """
    Execute a command remotely and return the output.
    
    Args:
        command (str): The command to execute.
        timeout (float): Execution timeout.

    Returns:
        str: The command output.
    """
```

This function will be called internally by Toboggan to execute commands remotely. It uses [`modwrap`](https://pypi.org/project/modwrap/) under the hood.

### Considerations

Your `execute()` function must handle all quirks of the target system.

- If space characters need to be replaced (e.g., with `${IFS}`), handle that inside the function.
- If special encoding is required (e.g., base64, hex), apply it before sending.
- If the system echoes extra characters or wraps the output, sanitize it.
- If the remote interface is slow or unreliable, tune the timeout.

The goal is for Toboggan to call your `execute()` function with any arbitrary command and get the correct output, as if you typed it in a shell.

## üèóÔ∏è Making Dumb Shells Smarter

### Named Pipes for Semi-Interactive Shells

Toboggan uses named pipes (FIFO - First In, First Out) for inter-process communication (IPC). Named pipes are particularly useful when working with RCE over limited channels like HTTP requests or restricted command execution interfaces. It uses a `mkfifo` command under the hood. Also known as forward-shell style.

This allows Toboggan to simulate pseudo-TTY behavior, even in restricted environments behind firewalls. To enable named pipe mode, use the `--fifo` flag:
```shell
toboggan -m ~/phpexploit.py --fifo
```

Toboggan will create a FIFO-based communication channel, allowing you to interact with the remote system in a more dynamic way (e.g., using `sudo -l`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Bring Your Own Actions (BYOA)

Actions in Toboggan are modular plugins that allow you to extend its functionality. Actions can automate common post-exploitation tasks, such as downloading files, executing scripts, or setting up persistent access. Custom actions should be placed in `~/.local/share/toboggan/actions` (Linux) or `%APPDATA%\toboggan\actions` (Windows).
