    Scans for readable files in other users' home directories.
    Useful for identifying permission misconfigurations or information leaks.

    This action uses the `find` command to look through `/home`, skipping the current
    user's own directory. It lists files that are world-readable or accessible by the
    current user due to permissive file settings.

    Errors like permission denials are suppressed to focus on positive hits.
