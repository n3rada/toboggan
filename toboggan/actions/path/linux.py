    Inspect the remote PATH environment variable.

    This action prints the current contents of the PATH variable from the target system,
    providing insight into the order in which binaries and scripts are located during execution.

    Use this to:
    - Identify binary hijack opportunities.
    - Spot suspicious or non-standard directories.
    - Debug misconfigured environments (e.g., missing /usr/bin).

    Example output:
        1. /usr/local/sbin
        2. /usr/local/bin
        3. /usr/sbin
